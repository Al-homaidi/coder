## üìù Notes

- This project is **full-stack**, meaning both frontend and backend logic are included within the same app.
- API endpoints can be found under the `/app/api` or `/pages/api` directory depending on the project structure.
- You can build and run the app in production using:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Make sure all required environment variables are correctly configured before deployment.
